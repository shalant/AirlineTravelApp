# ATA Airlines
This is project 1 for SkillStorm NextGen .NET cohort. It features a .NET backend using EF Web API and SQLServer which can be found here: https://github.com/DougRosenbergDev/AirTravelApp3/. You are presently viewing the frontend code, which uses Angular.

## Run on your own machine
To make this project work, clone both front- and back-end repositories and run npm install from the console for each. Open backend in Visual Studio, click on AirlineTravelApp.sln, clean solution, build solution, and press play. A Swagger API UI will open in the browser, which means the backend is running. Open frontend in Visual Studio Code, open a terminal, and run "ng serve". Open a browser and navigate to localhost:4200/

## What works and what doesn't work?
This app is able to view/viewById/create/delete Flights, Passengers, and Bookings. The backend was a little broken with editing. In the future, I would like to go back and tweak the .NET model to simplify updates. Another goal would be to auto-generate a confirmation number for every booking.
