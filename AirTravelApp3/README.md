# AirTravelApp

This is the backend code for a first project. The frontend code is an Angular app here: https://github.com/DougRosenbergDev/ATA-Front.

The code found here is a .NET EF Core Web API, and is hosted here: https://ata-airlines.azurewebsites.net/swagger/index.html.
When you browse to the URL, observe a UI made my Swagger, which allows you to Create/Read/Update/Delete on the DB.
This app was first developed in Visual Studio, and recently hosted on Azure Web Services. This means the application is on a web server
and the DB is on a DB server all in the Azure Cloud.

# What this code does and does not do

Being 3 weeks into learning .NET EF Core, I was able to get Create/Read/ReadById/Delete running, but not Update. The project also required
us to issue a confirmation number upon adding a passenger to a flight, which I was also not able to implement.

# Future goals

I was love to revisit my basic programming skills and develop the update functionality and do more interesting things with bookings.
As of 25-Aug-22, I also have not hosted the frontend Angular site on Azure, and connected the two.
